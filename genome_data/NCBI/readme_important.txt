NCBI .gff files lacks UTR 5' and UTR 3' features. 
In order to add these features run script add_ustrs_to_gff.py
after that use any converter tool to change text format to the ANSII unicode.

add_ustrs_to_gff.py is written by "David Managadze" (NCBI worker) 
and this script was suggested for use in NCBI's readme files.
